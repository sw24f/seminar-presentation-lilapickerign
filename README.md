Causal Inference in the Social Sciences

In “Causal inference in the Social Sciences”, by Guido Imbens explores how we currently estimate causal effects and methods as it pertains to experimental and observational. There are four main areas he looks to throughout this article. The randomization of controlled trials and their design is the first. Then he moves to discuss observational studies with unconfoundedness and without. Lastly he looks at both observational and experimental together. How they work together and areas where there are needed improvements. Particularly there are two main ways he looks to combine observational and experimental, they are Surrogacy and removing bias by the incorporation of experiments. This review brings to light important information about how best to conduct analysis as the field of social sciences is growing and credible results are necessary
